### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<img src="https://badges.pufler.dev/visits/Khaaz/khaaz?style=for-the-badge&logo=pinboard" alt="now playing, from discord">

Software engineer student currently completing a M-eng, majoring in computer science.  
I code for work and for fun. Most of my open source work can be found here.  

I have been doing a lot of javascript, mainly around the discord API. I created [AxonCore](https://github.com/Khaaz/AxonCore), an universal command framework for node.js Discord API wrappers.
